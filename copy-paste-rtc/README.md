copy-paste-rtc
==============

This is a simple rtc data connection with offerer and answerer. 

I've made it to understand better the webrtc handshake, so it uses copy & paste
to do the external signaling part.

To use it, open [copy-paste-server.html](https://rawgithub.com/massahud/webrtc-tests/master/copy-paste-rtc/copy-paste-server.html) 
and [copy-paste-client.html](https://rawgithub.com/massahud/webrtc-tests/master/copy-paste-rtc/copy-paste-client.html) 
on separate browser windows or tabs. Then open the javascript console and follow the
instructions.
