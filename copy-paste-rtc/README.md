copy-paste-rtc
==============

This is a simple rtc data connection with offerer and answerer. 

I've made it to understand better the webrtc handshake, so it uses copy & paste
to do the external signaling part.

To use it, open copy-paste-server.html and copy-paste.client.html on separate
browser windows or tabs. Then open the javascript console and follow the
instructions.
