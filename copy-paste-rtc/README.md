copy-paste-rtc
==============

This is a simple rtc data connection with offerer and answerer. 

I've made it to better understand the webrtc handshake, so it uses copy & paste to do the external signaling part. 

The current version works only on Chrome, because Firefox's handshake is a little different, and I still have not had time to study it.

To use it, open [copy-paste-server.html](https://rawgithub.com/massahud/webrtc-tests/master/copy-paste-rtc/copy-paste-server.html) 
and [copy-paste-client.html](https://rawgithub.com/massahud/webrtc-tests/master/copy-paste-rtc/copy-paste-client.html) 
on separate browser windows or tabs. Then open the javascript console and follow the
instructions.

TODO
====
1. Make it work on firefox
2. Make it work cross-browser
