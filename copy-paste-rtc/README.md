copy-paste-rtc
==============

This is a simple rtc data connection with offerer and answerer. 

I've made it to better understand the webrtc handshake, so it uses copy & paste to do the external signaling part. 

The current version works only on Chrome-Chrome and Firefox-Firefox. Tested on Chrome 28 and Firefox 22. 


To use it, open [copy-paste-answerer.html](https://rawgithub.com/massahud/webrtc-tests/master/copy-paste-rtc/copy-paste-answerer.html) 
and [copy-paste-offerer.html](https://rawgithub.com/massahud/webrtc-tests/master/copy-paste-rtc/copy-paste-offerer.html) 
on separate browser windows or tabs. Then open the javascript console and follow the
instructions.

TODO
====
- Make it work cross-browser
